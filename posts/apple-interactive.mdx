# Apple interactive

The interactive chart below shows historical share price and quarterly revenue data for Apple (AAPL). Hover over (or tap) a data point to see its details. Drag the range sliders to zoom in to a subsection of the chart.

To embed the interactive chart in this page, I created a new GitHub repository for assets and hosted it on Netlify at [assets.realthreads.io](https://assets.realthreads.io/). I then embedded the chart into this page using an [iFrame](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.ASP).

I created the chart in [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) using [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [plotly python graphing library](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). I [exported the plotly chart to HTML](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/). 

I collected the historical share price data from Yahoo! Finance using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and scraped the historical revenue data from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/) using [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

You can find the Jupyter Notebook I used to create these charts on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/wemhr30/3c84b687abb824604a478b426be1e29f).
